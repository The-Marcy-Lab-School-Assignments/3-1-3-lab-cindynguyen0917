# Question
Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - Means fullfillment of the request was successful. HTTP responses will differ depending on the request verb.

2. 404 - Indicates the server could not find the requested information due to an input error (the URL was not valid or the information does not exist) so the request could not be fulfilled. 

3. 500 - Indicates that the server ran into an unexpected problem and isn't sure what to do-- the request will not be fulfilled due to this.
