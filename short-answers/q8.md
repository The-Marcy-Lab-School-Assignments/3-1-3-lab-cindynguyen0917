# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
Using semantic elements means using elements that clearly define the contents inside of the element. For example, `<form>` clearly indicates that the content inside of the element will be related to a form that takes input from the user. But an example of a non-semantic element would be `<div>`, which provides no information about the element upon first glance.
