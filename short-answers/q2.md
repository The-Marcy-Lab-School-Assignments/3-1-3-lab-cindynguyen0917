# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The 'request/response cycle' is the communication between two computers. In this communication, one computer is acting as the client that makes requests to the other-- which is referred to as the server. The request is normally paired with a URL to fetch the data from. The server will respond to any incoming request with a status code indicating success or failure, as well with the result of the request.
