# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. `type='module'` defers automatically meaning that it waits until all of the DOM content is loaded before executing the javascript. This is neccesary because within our javascript, we are manipulating the DOM and need elements to exist before we reference them in our code. If we were to just link our `src="index.js"`, we would need the keyword `defer` but it is still possible to run into other reference errors.

2. We don't have to deal with handling mutiple javascript files and global variables-- but more importantly order. When you have many different javascript files, you can link them all using `src=` however you can still run into reference errors because javascript is single threaded. Code will be executed in a certain order-- top to bottom. For example you may have code that reference functions or variables from other files, if that script is placed before the others, it will cause errors. And this becomes a problem when you create larger projects that may contain more than two javascript files. With `type=module`, we can access code from the modules created through the `export/import` functions without needing to link all of our javascript files.
