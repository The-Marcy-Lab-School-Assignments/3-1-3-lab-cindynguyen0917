# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
Similar to `element.appendChild()`, `element.append()` attaches the elements in that are passed through as arguments to the main element which the method is called on. It attaches it as the last child of the element. But the advtange `element.append()` has over `element.appendChild()` is that you can append mutiple elements at once rather than one at a time.
